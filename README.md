#ðŸ“Š Absenteeism Prediction Project
This repository contains a two-part machine learning project focused on predicting employee absenteeism based on various workplace and personal factors. The project leverages classical machine learning techniques to build, evaluate, and deploy a predictive model.

# Objective
To develop a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of an employee being absent from work, based on historical data including:
Reason for absence
Date of absence
Body Mass Index (BMI)
Education level
Work load and commuting distance
Other related factors
# Tools and Technologies
Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn,  
#Part 1: Data Analysis & Model Building (ABSENTEEISM__Project.ipynb)
Data loading and cleaning
Feature engineering (e.g., categorizing reasons, extracting date info)
Logistic Regression model training
Model evaluation
#Part 2: Model Deployment & Prediction (Absenteeism_Part_2.ipynb)
Reusable module absenteeism_module.py to:
Load the trained model and scaler
Clean and preprocess new data
Make predictions
ðŸ“š Results
Achieved 75% prediction
Extracted the most influential features impacting absenteeism
Built a reusable pipeline for real-time predictions
